## Background

This library provides a client that Web and node.js apps can use to interface
with remote Encrypted Data Vault (EDV) servers.

It consists of one main class:

1. `EdvClient` - instances provide a CRUD (+ find) interface to a specific
  configured Encrypted Data Vault server and ensure appropriate database
  indexes are set up. Static methods allow for the creation of EDVs with a
  remote storage service, e.g.
    [Encrypted Data Vault storage server](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/bedrock-data-hub-storage).

## Install

To install locally (for development):

```
git clone https://github.com/digitalbazaar/edv-client.git
cd edv-client
npm install
```

## Usage

### Creating and registering an Encrypted Data Vault (EDV)

First, create a key agreement key and an HMAC (hash-based message authentication
code) key for encrypting your documents and blinding any indexed attributes in
them. This requires creating some cryptographic key material which can be done
locally or via a KMS system. The current example shows using a KMS system
(TODO: show a simpler local example):

```js
import {ControllerKey, KmsClient} from 'web-kms-client';
import {EdvClient} from 'edv-client';

```
Although Encrypted Data Vaults are not bound to any particular key management
system, we recommend that you set up a Key Management Service using an
implementation such as
[`web-kms-switch`](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/web-kms-switch)
which you can connect to using
[`web-kms-client`](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/web-kms-client).

Optional:

```js
// Create a Controller Key (via a key management service)
const kmsService = new KmsService();
const controllerKey = await ControllerKey.fromSecret({secret, handle});

// TODO: create keystore for controllerKey and update
// controllerKey.kmsClient.keystore, or improve API to do this automatically

// Use the Controller Key to create key agreement and HMAC keys
const keyAgreementKey = await controllerKey.generateKey({type: 'keyAgreement'});
const hmac = await controllerKey.generateKey({type: 'hmac'});
```

Now you can create and register a new EDV configuration:

```js
// TODO: explain EDV service must be able to authenticate user
const controller = 'account id goes here';

const config = {
  sequence: 0,  // TODO: is sequence required?
  controller,
  // TODO: Explain what 'referenceId' is
  referenceId: 'primary',
  keyAgreementKey: {id: keyAgreementKey.id, type: keyAgreementKey.type},
  hmac: {id: hmac.id, type: hmac.type}
};

// sends a POST request to the remote service to create an EDV
const remoteConfig = await EdvClient.createEdv({config});

// connect to the new EDV via a `EdvClient`
const client = new EdvClient({id: remoteConfig.id, keyAgreementKey, hmac});
```

### Loading a saved EDV config

If you have previously registered an EDV config (via `createEdv()`),
and you know its `id`, you can fetch its config via `get()`:

```js
// registered config
const {id} = await EdvClient.createEdv({config});

// later, it can be fetched via the id
const remoteConfig = await EdvClient.getConfig({id});

// connect to the existing EDV via an `EdvClient` instance
const client = new EdvClient({id: remoteConfig.id, keyAgreementKey, hmac});
```

If you know a controller/`accountId` but do not know a specific EDV `id`, you
can create a client for an EDV by a controller-scoped custom `referenceId`:

```js
// get the account's 'primary' EDV config to connect to the EDV
// note that a referenceId can be any string but must be unique per controller
const config = await EdvClient.findConfig(
  {controller: accountId, referenceId: 'primary'});
const client = new EdvClient({id: config.id, keyAgreementKey, hmac});
```
